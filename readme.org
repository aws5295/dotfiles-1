* Install Instructions

- On linux, use =xfce-terminal=. Failing that, try to use any [[https://gist.github.com/XVilka/8346728][truecolor]] terminal.
- Secondly, this is for unix systems: =GNU/Linux=, =OSx=, BSDs. I don't know anything about windows.
- configure your terminal to use the dracula theme (or whatever theme you like). There's a [[https://draculatheme.com/][repo]] that can help you with that.
- *recommendation*: I use and recommend the excellent [[https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans][Fantasque Sans Mono]] font.
- now get =vim= 8+ with [[http://vimcasts.org/blog/2013/11/getting-vim-with-clipboard-support][+clipboard]].
- get [[https://github.com/tmux/tmux.git][tmux]] 2.5+
- get [[https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh.git][zsh]] 5.4+ and make sure that =/bin/zsh= is valid. (if not: =$ cd /bin && sudo ln -s $(command -v zsh) zsh=)
- =cat /etc/shells= and verify that zsh appears on the list. If not, =sudo vi /etc/shells= and append =/bin/zsh=
- get [[https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher.git][ag]] (you can =brew install ag= on OSx).
- if you're on OSx, brew install these:
  1. =brew install coreutils= (mainly because =BSD= =ls= =CLICOLOR= sucks).
  2. =brew install reattach-to-user-namespace= (Mainly because of the =open= utility. [[https://github.com/ChrisJohnsen/tmux-MacOSX-pasteboard.git][more info here]]).
  3. =brew install diff-so-fancy=

* Shell time
now lets write some shell commands.

- *note*: the install.zsh script basically does this:
  1. mounts symlinks on your home folder;
  2. creates ~/.options/shell-options.zsh file, if not existent
  3. sources the ~/.options/shell-options.zsh file
  4. overwrites your .gitconfig (so back it up if you have something important)
  5. tries to configure your git information, if applicable.
  6. fetches vim and zsh dependencies

- now open your shell and don't forget to set up your git information (=vim ~/.options/shell-options.zsh=)
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ git clone https://github.com/aws5295/dotfiles-1 && cd dotfiles-1 && make
$ vim ~/.options/shell-options.zsh
$ exec zsh
#+END_SRC

- That's it, your're all set.
- =make update= will update all dependencies.

* Consuming changes to the scripts

1. run =make=
2. =exec zsh=
